Mini Challenge 2 App

An integrated app where teachers are able to check students attendance and awareness.

Student can input particular class code which will assign you to particular room.

Teachers can use this for taking attendance.

The app will prevent students from opening other apps (sends notification to other members of the room when the user exits the app).

There’ll be an awareness check every 10 minutes (teachers can set the time interval) for the students to make sure that they don’t leave their workspace for more than the time given.
